/*C is like the building blocks of Legos for the computer world! Created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, it's a fundamental programming language that's still widely used today.

Here's what makes C special:

    *Powerful and Precise: C gives programmers a lot of control over how the computer works, making it great for building high-performance applications and system software like operating systems.

    *The Foundation for Many Languages: If you learn C, understanding other popular languages like Java, Python, or C++ becomes much easier because they share similar concepts.

    *Speed Demon: Compared to some other languages, C can be incredibly fast. This makes it ideal for situations where speed is critical, like in game development or embedded systems.

    *Versatile and Adaptable: C can be used to create a wide variety of software, from tiny programs to massive operating systems. It's a true all-rounder in the programming world.

Learning C might seem old-school, but it's like mastering the alphabet before writing a novel. It gives you a strong foundation for understanding how computers work and lays the groundwork for exploring other programming languages.

To start coding C you need a text editor and a compiler.
This tutorial is doing using a IDE(Code::Blocks),
so windows - Dev-C++
Linux - Code::Blocks
Mac - Dev-C++    etc....

Lets Print Hello World*/


#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    //output
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
